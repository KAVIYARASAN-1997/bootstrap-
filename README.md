# bootstrap
bootstrap Bootstrap mainly includes CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and an optional JavaScript-supported design template (plug-ins) that deals with typography, buttons, forms, and other user interface components. This Bootstrap framework helps rapid web development and supports developers in creating responsive web pages.

Twitter Blueprint was the first name for Bootstrap and was developed on Twitter by Mr. Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton. It was released as an open-source product on GitHub in August 2011. The framework is primarily built to encourage design uniformity and reliability of web pages across applications. Before its existence, developers used various external libraries to perform responsive web development, leading to incompatibilities in web development and heavy maintenance burdens.
